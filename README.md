1. Clustering of the IRIS dataset using k -means and k -medoids algorithms 
2. Classification of the IRIS dataset using single-layer and multi-layer perceptron neural network.
3. Implementation of Self-organising Feature Map(SOM) and Fuzzy-C-means to cluster the samples.
4. Implementation of Naive Bayesian classifier to classify patterns from IRIS dataset
5. SVM Classification on the multi-class data
6. Classification of given dataset using RBF and for initial cluster centers K-means is used
All the above algorithms have been implemented in Matlab
